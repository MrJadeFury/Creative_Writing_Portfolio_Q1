                    <h2>Profile - The Persona: Hidden Behind the Curtain</h2>
                    <p class="reflection_paragraph">
                        Everyone in their lives end up changing. Whether it would be physically, socially, or personality wise, people, as they grow older, mature to a big extent, good or bad. Knowing this, I thought to myself what people I have known for a long time that ended up changing for the better. The Girl was one of them. Having known the girl for a while now, I knew that I'd be able to have enough information to write about her. The reason why I call her the girl throughout the piece is due to multiple details that were included that she felt uncomfortable standing her name by. As a writer, I owe her the respect of her privacy and named her "The Girl" for the piece. Like most of my pieces, I enjoyed being able to look back at moments that I enjoyed while being with her and the moments that shocked me the most. Even though this was a good consequence of writing about close friends, it could also turn bad. I struggled heavily with trying to keep my composure when writing about these moments. Being an emotional person, these emotions impacted me a lot, making it difficult to write sometimes.

                        When thinking about writing a profile, the first ideas that came to my head was to plop the reader into various different memories while giving them background information in between. This was mainly inspired by "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold" by Gay Talese. Throughout this profile, the author does a great job at flowing in background information into his memories while still being able to make the whole piece flow smoothly. This set goal of making a smooth road for the reader to travel on was what I kept in my head while writing. This allowed me to do my best to make an impactful piece that hopefully puts you in my perspective during that moment.

                    <h2>Literary Journalism - An Outside World Sucked by Technology</h2>
                    <p class="reflection_paragraph">
                        The influence that Technology has had on our world is something that most people tend to overlook. Ever since the introduction of new ways to entertain yourself through various technological devices, people in our world have been abandoning their old entertaining activities. Groups and cities would gather together to watch people live, in person, performing various activities that could be a sport, theatrical performance, or maybe a presentation about a certain topic. With the introduction of other technological activities such as eSports, online communities, and technological gatherings, the way that we entertain ourselves changed as well. As more and more people became engulfed by technology, we ended up switching over to this new way of entertainment. This was something that I wanted to bring awareness to, hence why this piece was written.

                        The challenge in writing this piece mainly lies in trying to figure out how to connect such vastly different activities and ideas, and turn them into one whole object. Looking at two main focuses of the piece, NASCAR and eSports, it is not obvious as to how these two topics can be related. Stock cars racing and people playing video games are two very different activities. Putting these two ideas together was probably one of the biggest challenges.

                        Being able to bring awareness about this phenomenon that we leaned towards as the years went on gave me the satisfaction that I had successfully brought people's attention to a topic that doesn't get that much attention. This is kind of the case for Lee Gutkind's "You Can't Make This Stuff Up". They talk about something taht most people don't think of everyday, literary journalism, and tried to bring more awareness to it. This was a goal I had in mind when writing this piece, hence the satisfaction.

                    <h2>Memoir - The Missunderstanding</h2>
                    <p class="reflection_paragraph">
                        It is important for one to take responsibility for their actions. We should own what we do, both good and bad, and recieve the outputs of each decision we make. This is very true for most situations, but sometimes, people can bash on other people for failing to do their tasks because of something out of their control. Most people, despite the constant attention mental health is getting today, still don't aknowledge that it is truly an issue that sometimes can't be controlled and can take years or even decades to fully fight off. This main idea was what inspired me to tell on of my memories where I was feeling down and got bashed for it, despite warning others that it was coming.

                        Being able to try to get more people to understand what other people may be going through when they can't do what they normally do in their lives makes me happy. I don't want other teens in the future to go through what I went through while attending school regularly. People around that age need to understand that "manning up" can't always be the answer. We have to encourage those suffering to do better through positivity instead of bashing on them for not completeing everything they had to do just because someone made their day bad. Having written several different memiors before, I kind of just let my mind write away, telling the memory in full as best as I can. Like the profile, this was probably the most challenging part of writing the piece since writing in this much detail brings back the memory and can sometimes make me upset or break down. There wasn't really a course reading I went off of for this piece, but rather just a session of my thoughts flowling from my head to the document.
