                <p>The author of these pieces of writing is Nicholas Pangilinan, a current senior enrolled in high school. He has been writing throughout his education in high school and continues to do his best to improve his writing and become better at portraying his ideas to his readers. Through his writing pieces, he has been striving to address topics that most people tend to avoid that he believes should be discussed in our world. Based off of personal experiences and observations, he strives to share his findings with the world and bring awareness to certain aspects of our society that can be treated as not as important. From indirect societal influence, to our rapidly changing interests, he will cover in depth focus points from each topic in an attempt to address his audience certain issues that are normally overlooked or forgotten. In doing so, he hopes to bring awareness about these issues that should be talked about more to his readers. Over the past two months, he has composed three pieces, one profile, one literary journalistic piece, and a memoir, hoping to bring light to three more of these controversial topics: Our achievement based society, the shift of our society's view on sports, and societal exclusion.</p>
